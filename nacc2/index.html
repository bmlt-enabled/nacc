            This is an example of an entirely browser-based NA Cleantime Calculator (NACC).
            You need to include the "nacc.js" and "nacc.css" files, as well as the "images"
            directory, into the same directory as this file.

            This will be the element that will contain the NACC. It is populated by JavaScript.
            The element will have its class changed to ".NACC-Instance". If a "theme" has been
            chosen, then an additional class will be added to indicate the theme.
            
            For example, for the default (gray) theme, the classname will be "NACC-Instance".
            for the BT theme (Blue and white), the class will be "NACC-Instance NACC-BT".
            
            If you have already specified a class name, then that will be honored.

            This is where the JavaScript implementation is called.
            
            Here are the parameters that you can use (This example only passes in the first one):
                new NACC
                    (
                    inContainerElementID    A DOM ID to the DOM element that will contain this instance. It will usually be an empty div element, but can be any block-level DOM element.
                    inStyle                 This is the style (leave blank/null for default gray. The "BT" style would be 'NA-BT', as that is the CSS name it has been given).
                    inLang                  A string, with the language selector (Example: 'en' -the default-, 'es' -Spanish-, etc.).
                    inTagLayout             The tag layout (either 'linear' or 'tabular' -default is 'linear')
                    inShowSpecialTags       If true, then the "specialty" (over 2 years) tags are displayed. Default is false.
                    inDirectoryRoot         This is a path (relative to the execution path) to the main directory. Leave as '' or null for standard implementations.
                    inYear                  An initial calculation year (integer -entire year, like '1953'). If you want the instance to immediately appear with a calculation, then ALL 3 of these must be specified.
                    inMonth                 An initial calculation month (integer 1-12). If you want the instance to immediately appear with a calculation, then ALL 3 of these must be specified.
                    inDay                   An initial calculation day (integer 1-31). If you want the instance to immediately appear with a calculation, then ALL 3 of these must be specified.
