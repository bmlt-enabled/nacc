That text will be replaced with this cleantime calculator.

1. Upload `the nacc` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<!-- NACC -->`in the HTML view, or `[[NACC]]` in either view, of a page. It will be replaced by the plugin.
4. You can change how the plugin appears like so: `<!-- NACC(`THEME`) -->`, where `THEME` is currently `NACC-BT` (Dark blue and white), `NACC-GNYR2` (Light blue style customized for the Greater New York Region), or "NACC-HOLI" (Black and Red, customized for the Heart of Long Island ASC). Leave it out for default (gray).
5. You can change the language like so: `<!-- NACC(`THEME`,`LANG`) -->`, where `LANG` is currently `en` (English -Default), `es` (Spanish), `zh-Hans` (Simplified Chinese), `zh-Hant` (Traditional Chinese), or `it` (Italian).
6. You can specify which layout (vertical or horizontal) you want the tags to appear in by default, like so: `<!-- NACC(`THEME`,`LANG`,`LAYOUT`) -->`, where `LAYOUT` is `linear` (default, in a long line), or `tabular` (In a horizontal row).
7. You can specify whether or not the "special" tags are shown, like so: `<!-- NACC(`THEME`,`LANG`,`LAYOUT`,`SPECIAL`) -->`, where `SPECIAL` is `true` or `false`.
